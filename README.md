# SEIRS Model Simulation
This is the course project for 'complex network analysis'. In this project, I made simulations of the spreading process of messages.

In my model, the linkage possibility measures the average number of nodes that one node is connected with.

If the linkage possibility is low, then the network is sparsely connected, the people is exposed to the messages at low frequency, and the messages are spread at a lower rate.

If the linkage possibility is high, then the network is densely connected, the people is exposed to the messages at high frenquency, and the messages are spread at a higher rate.

My observations in the simulations are as follows:

1. If the linkage possibility is below a certain value, most people will develop resistance to the message eventually. Only a small fraction of people will become the advocates of the new messages and form a latent subculture. Because the messages are spread at a low rate, a small proportion of people will stay naive to the messages.

2. If the linkage possibility is beyond a certain value, the public will fall into two distinct groups: the pros and the cons. This is the case of a heated debated issue: most people have definite attitudes and few people are equivocal about the issue.

3. If the linkage possibility falls into a certain range, then the attitudes of the public will alter periodically. In reality, fashion might spread like this.
